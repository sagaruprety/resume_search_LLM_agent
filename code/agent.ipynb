own potential and interests and curiosity in learning.\\nDesigning an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on\\ntheir interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially,\\nemotionally, physically, and intellectually.\\nI believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with\\ntools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum.\\nLetting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them.\\nMy personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets.\\nStudents should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the\\ndirect answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity.\\nI would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child's needs and interests.\\nCurriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and\\nthemselves.\\nMotivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child.\\nRecording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the\\nchildren.\\nGiving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a\\ngreat feeling.\\nGiving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child.\\nDeveloping trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions.\\nMake the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable.\\nGiving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend\\nmore time in school than any other place.\\nI believe in the quote 'A strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong', I would encourage more of the outdoor\\nactivities during the supporting weather.\\nI feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in\\noutdoor group activities.\\nA healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy\\nfoods, and less sodium and sugar.\\nI would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher.\\nI understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of\\ncherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children.\\nEnjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school\\nleaving the parents.\\nMy philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work

Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that\\nparameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers\\nthat arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful\\nimplementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives\\nsuch as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface\\nand make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during\\npeak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT\\nteams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i\\ninfrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production\\nenvironment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the\\nsystem to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99%\\ncompliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and\\napproval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within\\nthe scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run\\nteam was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing\\nmaintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow\\nfor a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management\\nLeadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which\\nI filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus\\non and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague.\\nImplemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure\\nof the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to\\n7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be\\ncompleted within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10\\n- 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of\\nknowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain\\nbusiness functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.\\nEducation\\nBachelor's\\n \\n, \\nComputer Information Systems\\n \\nDeVry University\\n \\nï¼\\u200b \\nCity\\n \\n, \\nState\\n \\n, \\nUS\\n \\n9/2000 - 6/2004 DeVry University, Alpharetta, Georgia\\nBachelor's Degree, Computer Information Systems Academic Honors: Dean's List, Hope Scholarship GPA 3.46 while working and attending\\nschool full-time\\nAffiliations\\nGivingBack Foundation, Inc\\nCertifications\\nSix Sigma Green Belt Certified\\nSkills\", metadata={'source': '../data/INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY/28126340.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Marketing, Operations, Database, Asp, Ms Sql Server, Sql, Sql Server, Technical Support, Testing, Asp.net, Budget, Clients, Database Systems,\\nLife Cycle, Linux, Ms Asp, Ms Sql Server 2000, Mysql, Online Solutions, Php, Project Launch, Solutions, Sql Server 2000, System\\nDevelopment, Closer, Media Strategy, Networking, Online Marketing, Bank Card, Collections, Credit, Data Migration, Receivables, Intranet,\\nMaintenance, Application Support, Archiving, Data Management, Subject Matter Expert, Work Flow, Business Requirements, Engineer, Finance,\\nGraphical User Interface, Increase, Kronos, Load Balancing, Offshore, Oracle, Payroll, Production Environment, User Interface, Belt Certified,\\nBlack Belt, Six Sigma, Six-sigma, .net, Associate, Client/server, Coding, Css, Customer Service, Database Management, Detail Oriented, Dhtml,\\nFlash, Frontpage, Html, Javascript, Microsoft Sql Server, Microsoft Sql Server 2000, Minitab, Ms Office, Photoshop, Project Management,\\nReceptionist, Retail Sales, Self Motivated, Software Development, Structured Software, Team Player, Test Plans, Time & Attendance, Time And\\nAttendance, Visual Studio, Xml', metadata={'source': '../data/INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY/28126340.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='SENIOR VICE-PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER\\nCore Accomplishments\\nStrategized with various areas of business to develop a proof of concept with an international financial company headed by a world-renowned\\nNobel Peace Prize winner to establish the principle of micro-lending for low income, immigrant families\\nProfessional Experience\\nSenior Vice-President and Chief Information Officer\\n \\n, \\n01/2009\\n \\nto \\nCurrent\\n \\nCompany Name\\n \\nï¼\\u200b \\nCity\\n \\n, \\nState\\nIndustry expert in a wide variety of technology systems, business applications and IT service management.

TECHNICALS SKILLS:\\nProgramming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio\\n2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery,\\nCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1)\\nLEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is\\nalso used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project\\nwas to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding\\nadditional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on\\ncertain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.\\nUBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee\\nid, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will\\ndecide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception\\nrecords. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)\\nSupplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of\\nseven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can\\naccess required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the\\nmain communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL\\nServer 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two\\nparties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The\\nexisting process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and\\napproval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to\\ncapture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to\\nvalidate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a\\nweb based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an\\nability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk\\ndata into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data\\nthat can be uploaded into each column.
